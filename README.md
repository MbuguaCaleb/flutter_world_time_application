# flutter_world_time_application
```
(1)stful is the shortcut for autogenerating a stateful widget.

(2)Two ways there are for handling imports

(a)import 'pages/home.dart';

(b)import 'package:flutter_world_time_application/pages/home.dart';
 method(b) is more recommeded.

 (c)Safe Area is a Widget that used to push the content down such that
 they do not hide the date and time in phone default app bar..It pushes the  content slightly
 down.

 Safe Area comes in handy when you are not using an app bar.
 An appBar is advantageous since it brings the content down automatially.

```
(a)Routes in flutter are a MAP with a key value pair of the url they redirect and function that
returns the widget they are redirecting to taking context object as a parameter.

context helps the widget in knowing where they are in the tree.
